 #### 1）Voted to reward： 
  &emsp; &emsp;After voting, users will get rewards according to the size of the voting amount and the size of the total voting amount. See the rules of rewards<a href='publish.html?language=en'>Help instructions</a>--Dpos voting reward system, detailed explanation
 #### 2）Redemption of lock： 
  &emsp; &emsp;If the voting amount is redeemed, the redemption amount will be saved in the redemption address, and the total amount will be locked in the redemption address for 100 days. The lock will be released at the rate of 1% of the total amount every day, that is, 1% can be redeemed every day.
  > For example, if there are 2000 voting addresses and 1000 is redeemed, then there are 1000 remaining voting addresses and 1000 more redeemable addresses, then on day 0, the address locking amount is 1000 and the redeemable amount is 0; on day 1, the address locking amount is 990 and the redeemable amount is 10; on day 2, the address locking amount is 980. Redemption address redeemable amount 20, and so on,

  If there is a locked amount in the redemption address and the investment is withdrawn again, the locked amount in the redemption address = the original locked amount + the investment withdrawal amount, and the unlock will be calculated at 1% per day again
 #### 3）The awarding：
 &emsp; &emsp;Rewards are issued once a day, calculated by height, which is 4320 height per day. When height is divided by 4320 more than 1, rewards are issued. If a block cannot store all reward transactions, reward transactions will be stored in the following block.
 #### 4）Warm prompt：
 &emsp; &emsp;It is recommended to vote for a long time and continue to gain income. If the voting amount is redeemed, considering the handling fee, it is recommended to redeem the locked amount in the redemption address after it is fully unlocked
